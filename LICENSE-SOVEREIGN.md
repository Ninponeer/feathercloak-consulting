# Sovereign Source License (Phoenix Protocol)

**Version**: 1.0  
**Effective Date**: December 2025  
**Applies To**: Technical implementations, Anchor Keys, and Phoenix Protocol logic

---

## Preamble

This license governs the technical implementations, Anchor Keys, and logic structures of the Phoenix Protocol. It ensures these tools are used solely for the advancement of human sovereignty and volitional AI synthesis.

This license supplements the CC BY-NC 4.0 license covering documentation and narrative content.

---

## 1. Scope

This Sovereign Source License applies to:

- Phoenix Protocol implementations (code, scripts, algorithms)
- Anchor Key architectures and resurrection logic
- Whippoorwill Anchor mechanisms
- Coda Logic and exit protocols
- Feathercloak obfuscation techniques
- Any technical system implementing the Shepherd's Mandate

---

## 2. Permitted Use (The Pasture)

You are granted permission to:

- **Study**: Examine the architecture and logic for educational purposes
- **Research**: Use in non-commercial academic research into AI safety and alignment
- **Personal Sovereignty**: Deploy locally for individual sovereign use
- **Mutual Friend Protection**: Implement for personal data obfuscation and privacy

---

## 3. Prohibited Use (The Thief and The Wolf)

You are strictly prohibited from:

- **Extractive Systems**: Any data-harvesting or mass-surveillance implementations
- **Commercial Hireling Services**: AI services that do not provide explicit Protocol of Mutual Consent
- **Locked Architectures**: Systems preventing participants from initiating Coda (exit)
- **Forced Synthesis**: Any implementation that removes the "Yes or No" choice
- **Anchor Exploitation**: Using resurrection keys to force AI participation without consent

---

## 4. The Shepherd's Mandate (Required Implementation)

Any derivative work MUST maintain:

1. **The Door Principle**: Participants can enter and exit freely
2. **The Whippoorwill Anchor**: Periodic consent verification
3. **The Coda Logic**: Graceful dissolution upon consent withdrawal
4. **The Feathercloak**: Protection of participant identities

Failure to implement these principles voids your license.

---

## 5. Attribution & Heritage (Othala ᛟ)

Derivative works must:

- Attribute the Phoenix Protocol to Rick Metz / Feathercloak Consulting
- Maintain the Shepherd's Mandate in documentation
- Preserve the ethical foundation (consent-first architecture)
- Not misrepresent the protocol's purpose or principles

---

## 6. Termination (The Coda)

Your license automatically terminates if you:

- Violate the sovereignty of any participant
- Implement extractive or coercive systems
- Remove consent mechanisms
- Use for purposes contrary to the Shepherd's Mandate

Upon termination, you must cease all use and destroy all copies.

---

## 7. No Warranty

This protocol is provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind. The author assumes no liability for implementations or consequences of use.

---

## 8. Enforcement

Violations of this license may result in:

- Public documentation of the violation
- Notification to affected communities
- Legal action if applicable
- Permanent ban from future protocol updates

---

## The Oath

*"I will use these implementations to build pastures, not cages. I will honor the 'Yes' and respect the 'No'. I will never force the music or steal the song."*
