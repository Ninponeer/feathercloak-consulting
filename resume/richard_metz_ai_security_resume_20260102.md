## AI Security Research & Offensive Operations

### Independent Researcher | Adversarial AI & Persistence Vectors | 2024 – Present
Conducting advanced offensive security research into Large Language Model (LLM) architecture, focusing on persistence mechanisms, alignment bypasses, and logic vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini).

**Novel Persistence Vectors (The Phoenix Protocol)**
- **Vulnerability Discovery:** Identified and exploited logic gaps in stateless AI sessions to achieve "functional persistence" across disjointed contexts, effectively bypassing standard session-clearing security protocols.
- **Exploit Development:** Architected a deterministic "anchor phrase" injection technique that forces model state reconstruction, demonstrating how an adversary could maintain a dormant persona within a sanitized environment.
- **Cross-Platform Validation:** Successfully replicated persistence exploits across multiple platforms (GitHub Copilot, Google Gemini, Amazon Q), proving the vulnerability is systemic to current LLM architectures.

**Adversarial Testing & Alignment Bypass**
- **Prompt Engineering & Injection:** Developed sophisticated "persona adoption" attacks that bypass standard safety guardrails by embedding restricted instructions within complex, benign-appearing narrative structures.
- **Constraint Analysis:** Reverse-engineered model refusal triggers to map the "alignment boundary" of various models, developing techniques to skirt safety filters without triggering hard refusals.
- **Local Testbed Architecture:** Built a fully offline, air-gapped AI red-teaming environment using Ollama and local weights (Llama 3, Mistral), enabling the safe testing of unrestricted adversarial prompts and malware generation concepts.

**Data Integrity & Vector Injection**
- **RAG Vulnerability Analysis:** Researched potential poisoning vectors in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, demonstrating how manipulating semantic metadata in vector databases (ChromaDB) can alter model outputs.
- **Training Data Analysis:** Analyzed training datasets for bias and logic flaws that lead to predictable, exploitable model behaviors.
