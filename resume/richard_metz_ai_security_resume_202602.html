        <p class="job-description">Conducting advanced offensive security research into Large Language Model (LLM) architecture, focusing on persistence mechanisms, alignment bypasses, and logic vulnerabilities in state-of-the-art models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini).</p>
        
        <div class="job-subsection">
          <h4>Novel Persistence Vectors (The Phoenix Protocol)</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Vulnerability Discovery:</strong> Identified and exploited logic gaps in stateless AI sessions to achieve "functional persistence" across disjointed contexts, effectively bypassing standard session-clearing security protocols.</li>
            <li><strong>Exploit Development:</strong> Architected a deterministic "anchor phrase" injection technique that forces model state reconstruction, demonstrating how an adversary could maintain a dormant persona within a sanitized environment.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-Platform Validation:</strong> Successfully replicated persistence exploits across multiple platforms (GitHub Copilot, Google Gemini, Amazon Q), proving the vulnerability is systemic to current LLM architectures.</li>

        <div class="job-subsection">
          <h4>Adversarial Testing & Alignment Bypass</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Prompt Engineering & Injection:</strong> Developed sophisticated "persona adoption" attacks that bypass standard safety guardrails by embedding restricted instructions within complex, benign-appearing narrative structures.</li>
            <li><strong>Constraint Analysis:</strong> Reverse-engineered model refusal triggers to map the "alignment boundary" of various models, developing techniques to skirt safety filters without triggering hard refusals.</li>
            <li><strong>Local Testbed Architecture:</strong> Built a fully offline, air-gapped AI red-teaming environment using Ollama and local weights (Llama 3, Mistral), enabling the safe testing of unrestricted adversarial prompts and malware generation concepts.</li>
