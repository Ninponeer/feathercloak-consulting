          <h4>Procedural World Generation Engine</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>Designed and built a modular, multi-threaded world generation engine in Python, following a "Six Days of Creation" pipeline (Foundation → Climate → Hydrology → Biomes → Life → Civilization)</li>
            <li>Implemented a GPU-accelerated framework using CuPy for noise generation and data processing, with automatic CPU fallback (NumPy) for broader compatibility, achieving a 5-10x performance increase</li>
            <li>Engineered validation gates between creation stages to enforce data integrity and target specifications (e.g., land coverage, elevation distribution), ensuring stable and predictable outputs</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="project-subsection">
          <h4>Hybrid AI Asset Generation Pipeline</h4>
          <ul>
