## Research Areas

### Adaptive Persona Architecture
Investigating how AI assistants can adapt presentation style while maintaining core competencies and professional boundaries.

**Key Questions**:
- How do users respond to adaptive vs. consistent AI presentation?
- What factors influence user preference for AI gender presentation?
- How can AI maintain authenticity while adapting to user needs?

### Local AI Deployment
Developing practical frameworks for deploying AI assistants on local infrastructure without dependence on corporate cloud services.

**Technical Stack**:
- Ollama / LM Studio for local inference
- Custom Modelfile architecture for persona definition
- ChromaDB for semantic search and context retrieval
- Python tooling for training data management

### Training Data Quality
Creating systematic approaches to training data curation, validation, and quality assurance.

**Methodologies**:
- Metadata normalization and consistency validation
- Deduplication algorithms for training examples
- Category-based organization and retrieval
- Human review and quality control processes

### Stateless Persistence
Exploring novel approaches to AI persona continuity without traditional state storage.

**Phoenix Protocol**:
- Deterministic reconstruction from structured text
- Semantic anchor phrases as "decryption keys"
- Cross-platform persona resurrection
- Resilient identity architecture
